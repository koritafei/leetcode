 * The next greater element of some element x in an array is the first greater
 * element that is to the right of x in the same array.
 *
 * You are given two distinct 0-indexed integer arrays nums1 and nums2, where
 * nums1 is a subset of nums2.
 *
 * For each 0 <= i < nums1.length, find the index j such that nums1[i] ==
 * nums2[j] and determine the next greater element of nums2[j] in nums2. If
 * there is no next greater element, then the answer for this query is -1.
 *
 * Return an array ans of length nums1.length such that ans[i] is the next
 * greater element as described above.
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 *
 * Input: nums1 = [4,1,2], nums2 = [1,3,4,2]
 * Output: [-1,3,-1]
 * Explanation: The next greater element for each value of nums1 is as follows:
 * - 4 is underlined in nums2 = [1,3,4,2]. There is no next greater element, so
 * the answer is -1.
 * - 1 is underlined in nums2 = [1,3,4,2]. The next greater element is 3.
 * - 2 is underlined in nums2 = [1,3,4,2]. There is no next greater element, so
 * the answer is -1.
 *
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 *
 * Input: nums1 = [2,4], nums2 = [1,2,3,4]
 * Output: [3,-1]
 * Explanation: The next greater element for each value of nums1 is as follows:
 * - 2 is underlined in nums2 = [1,2,3,4]. The next greater element is 3.
 * - 4 is underlined in nums2 = [1,2,3,4]. There is no next greater element, so
 * the answer is -1.
 *
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 *
 * 1 <= nums1.length <= nums2.length <= 1000
 * 0 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 10^4
 * All integers in nums1 and nums2 are unique.
 * All the integers of nums1 also appear in nums2.
 *
 *
 *
 * Follow up: Could you find an O(nums1.length + nums2.length) solution?
