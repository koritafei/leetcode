 * Testcase Example:  '[1,3,2,8,4,9]\n2'
 *
 * You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock
 * on the i^th day, and an integer fee representing a transaction fee.
 *
 * Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete as many
 * transactions as you like, but you need to pay the transaction fee for each
 * transaction.
 *
 * Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you
 * must sell the stock before you buy again).
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 *
 * Input: prices = [1,3,2,8,4,9], fee = 2
 * Output: 8
 * Explanation: The maximum profit can be achieved by:
 * - Buying at prices[0] = 1
 * - Selling at prices[3] = 8
 * - Buying at prices[4] = 4
 * - Selling at prices[5] = 9
 * The total profit is ((8 - 1) - 2) + ((9 - 4) - 2) = 8.
 *
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 *
 * Input: prices = [1,3,7,5,10,3], fee = 3
 * Output: 6
 *
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 *
 * 1 <= prices.length <= 5 * 10^4
 * 1 <= prices[i] < 5 * 10^4
 * 0 <= fee < 5 * 10^4
 *
